# CI/CD Pipeline Automation for Containerized Application Deployment on Azure

As a **DevOps Engineer**, I successfully designed and implemented a fully automated, production-grade CI/CD pipeline using **Azure DevOps**, enabling seamless integration, containerization, and deployment of web applications. This project demonstrates my ability to build scalable, secure, and efficient DevOps workflows aligned with modern cloud-native practices.

---

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Automate the entire software delivery lifecycle—from code commit to deployment—using Azure-native tools and Docker, ensuring faster, reliable, and repeatable releases.
- **Scope**: End-to-end CI/CD pipeline for a web application hosted on **Azure Web App for Containers**.

---

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Source Code Integration
- Integrated with **Azure Repos** to monitor code changes.
- Configured branch policies and pull request validations to maintain code quality.

### 2. CI Pipeline
- Triggered automatically on every commit to the main branch.
- Built the application using a custom **Dockerfile**.

### 3. Containerization & Image Management
- Created Docker images and tagged them with build IDs.
- Pushed images to **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** with version control.

### 4. CD Pipeline
- Pulled the latest image from ACR.
- Deployed the image to **Azure Web App for Containers**.
- Configured health checks and rollback strategies.

### 5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Provisioned and managed infrastructure using **Tasks**.

### 6. Monitoring & Logging
- Performing monitoring for real-time observability, performance tracking, and alerting.

##  Business Impact

-  90% reduction in manual deployment efforts.
-  Faster release cycles with automated testing and deployment.
-  Improved reliability and consistency.
-  Enhanced developer productivity through early feedback and reduced downtime.
